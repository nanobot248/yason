# Yet Another Simple Object Notation (YASON)
YASON is a small superset of JSON, compatible with the YAML language. It
extends JSON with support for (circular) references and typing (YAML tags).

This project was created as a support project for other projects and YASON
strings should be easily filterable by line-based filtering tools (e.g. grep).
Therefore YASON generators should not generate newlines by default, although
they are supported.

*YASON is JSON with the following YAML-compatible changes:*

* References: A referencable element can be defined by putting `&refname` in
  front of it and by using `*refname` to refer to it.
* Classes/Types/Namespaces: Elements can be classified using YAML-compatible
  tags (!tag, !!tag). A tag is defined as an exclamation mark followed by a
  sequence of non-whitespace characters. The tag ends with a whitespace
  character.
* By default no newlines at generation time, although newlines are supported
  by the parser, they should not be generated by the generator

A *YASON stream* is a sequence of YASON values. Two values are separated by a
newline and any number of whitespaces.

## Basic Usage

To serialize a single object, simply use the `stringify` method:
```javascript
var YASON = require("yason");
var obj = {
  test: [1, "b", {cde: "fgh"}],
  another_test: {another_key: "another value"}
};
obj["circular-reference"] = obj;
obj["test"].push(obj["another_test"]);
console.log(YASON.stringify(obj));
```

To deserialize a single object, use the `parse` method:
```javascript
var YASON = require("yason");
var str = '&root { lirum: "larum", "asdf": ["1", 2, "three", ' +
  '&ref0 {four: "5"}], root: *root, "refer to ref0": *ref0}';
console.log(YASON.parse(str));
```

## API

### stringify(value, options)
Converts the value (object, array, number, string, boolean, null) into a
YASON string. The method supports the following options:

* *classifier*: A function with the signature `classifier(value, container)`
  that returns the class (tag) that should be used for the value. The tag
  must not contain any whitespaces (including newlines). A "!" will be
  prepended automatically. If `null` is returned, no tag will be used for
  the value. `value` is the value that will be serialized next, container is
  the object or array that contains the value (or null).
